# What is Matter?

Matter (formerly Project Connected Home over IP, or Project CHIP) is a new
Working Group within the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA, formerly Zigbee
Alliance). This Working Group plans to develop and promote the adoption of a
new, royalty-free connectivity standard to increase compatibility among smart
home products, with security as a fundamental design tenet.

The goal of the Matter project is to simplify development for manufacturers and
increase compatibility for consumers. The project is built around a shared
belief that smart home devices should be secure, reliable, and seamless to use.
By building upon Internet Protocol (IP), the project aims to enable
communication across smart home devices, mobile apps, and cloud services and to
define a specific set of IP-based networking technologies for device
certification.



# Third Reality Matter Projects

Third Reality  has actively participated in Matter. By the end of 2022, it has just 
developed two night light products, providing open source code and hardware for 
interested developers to download code, compile and burn firmware to the light 
for testing. Users can voice control lights (switch lights, adjust colors, and brightness) 
on HomePod mini, HomePod, Google Nest, Amazon Echo and other speakers that 
support Matter. Needless to say, users can also control these lights through their 
mobile phones.

These two lamps have PIR motion sensor and light sensor inside. With the help of 
these sensors, developers can directly develop practical night light lighting products. 
Third Reality  will open source all relevant code at an appropriate time to facilitate 
developers. 

Third Reality keeps updating the software and hardware of the existing Matter 
products, and provides users with more reference examples (in fact, it is a product with 
complete functions, and it will be easier for users to modify the code on this basis, 
and can achieve full customization functions).  At the same time, develops new products 
that support Matter standard.

Third Reality will pay attention to the progress of the Matter and upgrade with it 
synchronously, so that users can experience the latest version of Matter earlier. 
Matter is as vibrant as the Amazon rainforest. Let's go ahead.

# Control the Night Light



## Use iPhone and HomePod mini

### Prepare

Upgrade the iPhone OS to 16.1.2 or higher

Confirm that the App Home is installed on your phone

Upgrade HomePod to version 16.1 or above


### Bind iPhone and HomePod

### Add a Night Light in Home

1. BL602 or BL706 light is connected to the computer

2. UART baud rate is set to 2000000, and power on again

3. From the uart log, copy URL similar to the following:

    `https://project-chip.github.io/connectedhomeip/qrcode.html?data=MT%3A6FCJ142C00KA0648G00`

    <u>*Note: For BL706 Night Light you can print the URL multiple times by short pressing the key*</u>

4. Open the URL above with a browser, and normally, there will be a QR code on the screen

5. Open the mobile phone Home App, click the "+" in the upper right corner, and select "Add accessories" from the pop-up menu

6. Scan the QR code of the night light on the pop-up interface, and add it according to the prompts. You can customize the location and name of the accessories at Home

7. Wait for the configuration to be completed, and there will be a new night light in Home

8. You can open the accessories interface to control the night light through touch, or control the light through voice interaction, such as "turn on all lights"


### Reset Apple HomePod

Power on the loudspeaker after power off for 10s

Wait for 5s after power on, press the middle position of the speaker with your index finger

Release after you hear 3 beeps, according to the speaker prompts, and there will be a chime


### Remove Accessories from Home
